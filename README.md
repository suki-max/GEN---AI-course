How to Extract After Download
The large project files are split into multiple parts (.zip.001, .zip.002, etc.). To join and extract them, you will need to use a file archiver like 7-Zip.
 * Download all segmented files for each task (e.g., TaskX.zip.001 to TaskX.zip.00N).
 * Use 7-Zip to join and extract the files. Simply navigate to the directory where you downloaded the files and open or right-click the first file in the sequence (.001). 7-Zip will automatically recognize and combine the parts to extract the full file.[1, 2]
